* In the home page, user will have two options for creating a session.

     

1). AI Chat-BOT: 

 User can use the AI Chat-BOT assistant and Chat-GPT which helps them with creating proper contents for their session. AI Chat-BOT collects some key informations about the session from the creator by using a simple conversational flow. With those key informations collected by AI Chat-BOT, Chat-GPT creates better contents for creator. For eg: session descriptions, session titles etc. 
        Once the conversation flow is over, user will be able to preview both contents generated by Chat-GPT and values collected by AI Chat-BOT.

2). Standard form:

User can also use a Standard form where he/she can manually enters all the details needed for creating a session and then publish it.

* After creating a session, the user will be able to see that session in the Upcoming tab. 
* Users can start a session by clicking on the Start button given in the session card  in the upcoming tab. Once the Start button is clicked, the user will be taken to the open-source video conference platform, Big Blue Button, where the session will be hosted. 

	



* If the User clicks on any of the session cards, he/she will be taken to the session details page of that specific session. The user will be able to edit and delete the session he created. Also, user can share their session with a different platform.
